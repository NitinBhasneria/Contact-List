  - Platform of the service is provided: You can get Java, Ruby, PHP as a service so you dont have to manage the binaries of the applications.
  - Software as a service: You get software as a service where you get email sending capabilities like SES.

  - #### Why aws is a hit?
  - Per hour billing.
  - Easy signup process.

  - Trusted Vendor.
  - #### Service overview
    1. **EC2(*Elastic Compute Cloud*)**: This is the service which gives you bare servers, so this servicewill give you a machine which oyu can launch and you can run your software on those. You can get small or big machines based on your requirements. 
    2. **VPC(*Virtual Private Cloud*)**: In this service amazon will not allow you full control of the cloud instead they gives you the chunks of the cloud which is **VPC**. So, VPC lets you create the network in the cloud and then run  your servers in those networks.
    3. **S3(*Simple Storage Service*)**: S3 gives you the opportunity to upload and share files so does mostly the file storage and sharing service.
    4. **RDS(*Relational Database Service*)**: RDS allows you to run and manage databases on the cloud, so they have all the major flavours of the databases like from SQl Server to Oracle and mysql. 
    5. **Route 53**: It is for dns, so they have got a managed DNS service where you can point your dns to amazon and they take care of the stuff. So, it's a global dns service it's a scalable dns service so it scales according to demand.
    6. **ELB(*Elastic Load Balancing*)**: It is a service which gives you the oppurtunity to load balanced incoming traffic to multiple machine so this way you can setup your web applications to any number of users.
    7. **Auto Scaling**: Adds the capacity on-the-fly to elastic load balancers so that your websit or your application is never down due to a load.
