This is my first MEAN Stack Application.
We are using mongoDB weith express. While we an use many other database with express which you can see [here](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html).

PS: I have made this application through the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtIvu085uU0&t=22s) of Edureka

## M: mongoDB
  - MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model.
  - It works on concept of collection and document.
  - Collection is a group of documents while document is a set of key value paris.
  - Saves data in key value pairs.
  - MongoDB saves data in binary format which makes it easier to pass data between client and server.

## E: Express
  - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
  - Idea of **Express** came Sinatra, which is popular framework based on **Ruby**.
